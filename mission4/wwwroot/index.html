                        There are several reasons why I want to learn about building web apps in C#. Firstly, C# is a powerful and versatile programming language that is well-suited for web development. It is an object-oriented language with a strong type system, making it easy to write reliable and maintainable code. Additionally, C# is built on top of the .NET framework, which provides a wide range of libraries and tools for web development, such as ASP.NET, which is a framework for building web apps and web APIs.
